Hi, I am Jiwei Zhang.

I am a Researcher at [ServiceNow Research](https://www.servicenow.com/company/research.html) and a PhD student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [École de Technologie Superieure, University of Quebec](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/). I am based in Montreal, Canada, but I am from Barcelona, Spain. I am advised by Prof. [Marco Pedersoli](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/mpedersoli/), Prof. [Chris Pal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1ScWJOoAAAAJ&hl=en), and Dr. [David Vazquez](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=1jHvtfsAAAAJ&hl=en)

My research interests are in the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, with a focus on multimodal generative models. I am interested in learning how to leverage information from different modalities to generate more accurate and controlable outputs in all modalities. Recently I have been working with large language and vision models using transformers and diffusion. I have also been exploring the paradigm of generating code as an alternative for generating images (e.g. scalable vector graphics).

I obtained a [M.Sc. in Computer Vision](https://mcv.uab.cat/) from [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB)](https://www.uab.cat/en/) with honors for my master thesis [Text to Scientific Figure Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11248) performed at ServiceNow Research and advised by Dr. [David Vazquez](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=1jHvtfsAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Pau Rodríguez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=IwBx73wAAAAJ&hl=ca). Previously, I obtained a B.Sc. in Telecommunication Networks Engineering from [Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)](https://www.upf.edu/en/) and carried out my bachelor thesis on [Handwritten Text Recognition](https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/46220/Rodriguez_2020.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) advised by Prof. [Xavier Binefa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1PId8CAAAAAJ&hl=en). I did research internships at UPF advised by Prof. [Xavier Binefa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1PId8CAAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Miquel Oliver](https://www.upf.edu/web/miquel-oliver), and at CVC-UAB advised by Prof. [Joost van de Weijer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Gsw2iUEAAAAJ&hl=ca).
